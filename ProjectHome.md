This is a fully plug-and-play multiseat solution that uses the Plugable's Docking Station with Video [0](0.md). This solution is based on a USB hierarchy makes an controlled environment, and this turns the problem easier to be solved. A USB hierarchy is a way of dispose the devices, a set of devices
(keyboard, mouse, ...) are attached in one USB HUB and this HUB is associated to one user, making one seat. The Plugable Docking station are more useful to make a USB hierarchy because the video is also in the HUB, so the seats are totally
separated. This kind of solution has some problems: Those USB HUBS must be fully plug-and-play, because user doesn't want to manually reconfigure the devices every time a USB HUB is detached from the machine.
